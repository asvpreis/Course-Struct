// Should the array needed be significantly longer, I would consider adding a check to ensure that
// the courses details are unique:
// 1 - loop through the array of courses
// 2 - create a new array of course structs
// 3 - if the dept code is the same as the one provided, pass the course struct to the new array by value
// 4 - loop through the new, smaller array to check for unique values
// 5 - return the number of unique courses
